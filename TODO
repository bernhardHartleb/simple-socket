General:
- clean size_t/int inconsistencies
  - size_t is used work together with the returns of the standard
    library
    this means we can e.g. ask send to send more data than the interface
    of send() can manage, since this only takes an int...
  - int is used as return types because e.g. recv returns an int
  - find a solutions that cleans up the mess...
UnixSockets:
- implement a unix stream socket
- allow to unlink created socket files

Dcumentation:
- document requirements (cmake, sctp)
- add example for SCTP communication

Testing:
- check the TCPSocket::sendAll function
- testcase for SCTP socket
- test library with other OS (BSD, Mac, Windows?)
- test library with other compilers (gcc3, icc, ...)
  - tested on gcc & clang

SCTPSocket:
- add proper receiveFlags
- implement all SCTP functions (primaryAddress)

SocketUtils:
- add function to change the name of a network interface
- time of last received packet (SIOCGSTAMP / SIOCGSTAMPNS)
- routing table maintenance (SIOCADDRT / SIOCDELRT / SIOCRTMSG)
- arp table maintenance (SIOCDARP / SIOCGARP / SIOCSARP)
